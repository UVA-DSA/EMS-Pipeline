Update in Sep 6 2023

1. Interface_v1 is the first version of BERT model integrated to EMSPipeline
2. Now we use Interface (second version of BERT model)
3. The difference is that Interface's now use TinyclinicalBERT (15M) while Interface_v2 use COReBERT (110M). And Interface_v2 only output one prediction (string), Interface output multiple predictions (list). I've updated the code to convert list to string
