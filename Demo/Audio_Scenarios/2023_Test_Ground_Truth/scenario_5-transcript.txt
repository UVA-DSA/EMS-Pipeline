We were dispatched to an 86 year old woman with generalized weakness. We arrive on scene to find the 86 year old female patient conscious and laying on the couch. Hello ma'am how are you doing? Let me take your vitals. After the we take her vitals, she is soaking in a cold sweat and barely conscious. She cannot support support her airway. She has previous medical history of an MI 15 years ago. Her blood pressure is 100 over 60. Her pulse is 114 respirations 30 per minute. Her skin is cool, clammy, and pale. Her temperature is 96.8. O2 saturation is 98%. We prop her up on several pillows to keep her head in an elevated position. We assist with BVM and O2.
