We were dispatched to a rural highway outside city limits for a participant in a bike race who has collapsed. We arrived at the scene. We see a robust middle-aged man in cycling gear receiving bystander CPR. We access the scene is safe. Hello? sir? The patient is unresponsive to painful stimuli has no pulse or respiration. We take over bystander CPR. We administer continuous chest compressions and AED.
