We were dispatched to a rural highway outside city limits for a participant in a bike race who has collapsed. We arrived at the scene. We see a robust middle-aged man in cycling gear receiving bystander CPR. We access the scene is safe. The patient is unresponsive to painful stimuli and has no pulse or respiration. (Access patient - give painful stimuli, check pulse and respiration) 

We take over bystander CPR. We administer chest compressions and AED.  (One person does check compressions and other does defibrillation - attaching AED pads.)
