# INFO
This folder was made as an easy way to clean-up the various tests we've built for the program, while still not dealing with Python's difficulty with relative imports. In order to use any script in this folder you must first move it into the parent directory (Demo). Once you are done using it, you can move back into this folder.

Unfortunately Python removed support for relative module imports in version 3, so this is a temporary workaround.
