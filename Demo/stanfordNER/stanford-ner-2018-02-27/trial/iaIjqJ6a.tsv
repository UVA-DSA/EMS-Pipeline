received		O
a		O
good		O
education		O

to		O
a		O

the		O
more		O
homely		O
pursuits		O
in		O
which		O
his		O

her		O
brother		O

his		O
wife		O

who		O
had		O
never		O
seen		O
him		O

and		O
who		O
were		O
full		O
of		O
pride		O
and		O
importance		O

which		O
the		O
connexion		O
would		O
offend		O

however		O

of		O
age		O

with		O
the		O

though		O
her		O
fortune		O
bore		O
no		O

not		O
to		O
be		O
dissuaded		O
from		O
the		O
marriage		O

it		O
took		O
place		O

to		O
the		O
infinite		O
mortification		O
of		O

who		O
threw		O
her		O

not		O

a		O
husband		O

warm		O
heart		O

made		O
him		O
think		O
every		O
thing		O
due		O
to		O
her		O

for		O
the		O
great		O
goodness		O
of		O

not		O

lived		O
beyond		O

was		O
nothing		O
in		O

of		O

did		O
not		O
cease		O
to		O
love		O

him		O
how		O
delightful		O
a		O
well-judging		O

truly		O
amiable		O
woman		O
could		O

it		O
was		O
not		O
in		O

nature		O
to		O

as		O
he		O
believed		O

so		O
deservedly		O

He		O
saw		O
his		O
son		O
every		O
year		O
in		O
London		O

and		O
was		O
proud		O
of		O
him		O

and		O
his		O
fond		O
report		O
of		O
him		O
as		O
a		O
very		O
fine		O
young		O
man		O
had		O
made		O
Highbury		O

a		O
sort		O
of		O
pride		O
in		O
him		O
too		O

a		O
kind		O
of		O

Mr.		PERS

was		O
one		O
of		O
the		O
boasts		O
of		O
Highbury		O

and		O
a		O
lively		O
curiosity		O
to		O
see		O
him		O
prevailed		O

though		O
the		O

Now		O
,		O
upon		O
his		O

marriage		O

it		O
was		O
very		O
generally		O
proposed		O

a		O
most		O

attention		O

that		O
the		O

the		O
