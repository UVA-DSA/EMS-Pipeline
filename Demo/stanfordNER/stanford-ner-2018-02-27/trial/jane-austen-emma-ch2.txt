CHAPTER II


Mr Weston was a native of Highbury and born of a respectable family
which for the last two or three generations had been rising into
gentility and property  He had received a good education but
on succeeding early in life to a small independence had become
indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers
were engaged and had satisfied an active cheerful mind and social
temper by entering into the militia of his county then embodied 

Captain Weston was a general favourite and when the chances
of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill
of a great Yorkshire family and Miss Churchill fell in love
with him nobody was surprized except her brother and his wife
who had never seen him and who were full of pride and importance
which the connexion would offend 

Miss Churchill however being of age and with the full command
of her fortune  though her fortune bore no proportion to the
family estate  was not to be dissuaded from the marriage and it
took place to the infinite mortification of Mr and Mrs Churchill
who threw her off with due decorum  It was an unsuitable connexion
and did not produce much happiness  Mrs Weston ought to have found
more in it for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper
made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness
of being in love with him but though she had one sort of spirit
she had not the best  She had resolution enough to pursue
her own will in spite of her brother but not enough to refrain
from unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger
nor from missing the luxuries of her former home  They lived beyond
their income but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe
she did not cease to love her husband but she wanted at once
to be the wife of Captain Weston and Miss Churchill of Enscombe 

Captain Weston who had been considered especially by the Churchills
as making such an amazing match was proved to have much the worst
of the bargain for when his wife died after a three years marriage
he was rather a poorer man than at first and with a child to maintain 
From the expense of the child however he was soon relieved 
The boy had with the additional softening claim of a lingering
illness of his mother's been the means of a sort of reconciliation
and Mr and Mrs Churchill having no children of their own
nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for offered to
take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease 
Some scruples and some reluctance the widower father may be supposed
to have felt but as they were overcome by other considerations
the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills
and he had only his own comfort to seek and his own situation to
improve as he could 

A complete change of life became desirable  He quitted the militia
and engaged in trade having brothers already established in a
good way in London which afforded him a favourable opening 
It was a concern which brought just employment enough  He had still
a small house in Highbury where most of his leisure days were spent
and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society
the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away 
He had by that time realised an easy competence  enough to secure
the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury which he had
always longed for  enough to marry a woman as portionless even
as Miss Taylor and to live according to the wishes of his own
friendly and social disposition 

It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence
his schemes but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth
on youth it had not shaken his determination of never settling
till he could purchase Randalls and the sale of Randalls was long
looked forward to but he had gone steadily on with these objects
in view till they were accomplished  He had made his fortune
bought his house and obtained his wife and was beginning a new
period of existence with every probability of greater happiness
than in any yet passed through  He had never been an unhappy man
his own temper had secured him from that even in his first marriage
but his second must shew him how delightful a well judging and truly
amiable woman could be and must give him the pleasantest proof
of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen
to excite gratitude than to feel it 

He had only himself to please in his choice his fortune was
his own for as to Frank it was more than being tacitly brought
up as his uncle's heir it had become so avowed an adoption
as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age 
It was most unlikely therefore that he should ever want his
father's assistance  His father had no apprehension of it 
The aunt was a capricious woman and governed her husband entirely
but it was not in Mr Weston's nature to imagine that any caprice
could be strong enough to affect one so dear and as he believed
so deservedly dear  He saw his son every year in London
and was proud of him and his fond report of him as a very fine
young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too 
He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his
merits and prospects a kind of common concern 

Mr Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury and a lively
curiosity to see him prevailed though the compliment was so little
returned that he had never been there in his life  His coming
to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved 

Now upon his father's marriage it was very generally proposed
as a most proper attention that the visit should take place 
There was not a dissentient voice on the subject either when
Mrs Perry drank tea with Mrs and Miss Bates or when Mrs and
Miss Bates returned the visit  Now was the time for Mr Frank
Churchill to come among them and the hope strengthened when it was
understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion 
For a few days every morning visit in Highbury included some mention
of the handsome letter Mrs Weston had received  I suppose you
have heard of the handsome letter Mr Frank Churchill has written
to Mrs Weston I understand it was a very handsome letter indeed 
Mr Woodhouse told me of it  Mr Woodhouse saw the letter and he
says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life

It was indeed a highly prized letter  Mrs Weston had of course
formed a very favourable idea of the young man and such a pleasing
attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense
and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression
of congratulation which her marriage had already secured  She felt
herself a most fortunate woman and she had lived long enough
to know how fortunate she might well be thought where the only
regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship
for her had never cooled and who could ill bear to part with her 

She knew that at times she must be missed and could not think
without pain of Emma's losing a single pleasure or suffering
an hour's ennui from the want of her companionableness but dear
Emma was of no feeble character she was more equal to her situation
than most girls would have been and had sense and energy
and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily
through its little difficulties and privations  And then there was
such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield
so convenient for even solitary female walking and in Mr Weston's
disposition and circumstances which would make the approaching
season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the
week together 

Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude
to Mrs Weston and of moments only of regret and her
satisfaction   her more than satisfaction  her cheerful enjoyment
was so just and so apparent that Emma well as she knew her father
was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity
poor Miss Taylor when they left her at Randalls in the centre
of every domestic comfort or saw her go away in the evening
attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own 
But never did she go without Mr Woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh
and saying Ah poor Miss Taylor She would be very glad to stay

There was no recovering Miss Taylor  nor much likelihood of
ceasing to pity her but a few weeks brought some alleviation
to Mr Woodhouse  The compliments of his neighbours were over
he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event
and the wedding cake which had been a great distress to him
was all eat up  His own stomach could bear nothing rich and he
could never believe other people to be different from himself 
What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body
and he had therefore earnestly tried to dissuade them from having
any wedding cake at all and when that proved vain as earnestly
tried to prevent any body's eating it  He had been at the pains
of consulting Mr Perry the apothecary on the subject  Mr Perry
was an intelligent gentlemanlike man whose frequent visits were one
of the comforts of Mr Woodhouse's life and upon being applied to
he could not but acknowledge though it seemed rather against the
bias of inclination that wedding cake might certainly disagree
with many  perhaps with most people unless taken moderately 
With such an opinion in confirmation of his own Mr Woodhouse hoped
to influence every visitor of the newly married pair but still the
cake was eaten and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till
it was all gone 

There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys
being seen with a slice of Mrs Weston's wedding cake in their
hands but Mr Woodhouse would never believe it
