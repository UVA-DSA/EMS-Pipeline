Upon entering the residence, an adult female patient was found laying in the supine position in a bed in a bedroom, not to our presence, with snoring respirations, without any signs of trauma and/or bleeding, and in moderate apparent distress. C: The patient was combative and confused. HPI: The patient's son reports that he takes care of his mother, came home from work this evening, checked on his mother, and was unable to arouse her. He notes that she is an IDDM but is not sure if she took her prescribed medications last night because he was at work. He notes that the patient has experienced similar symptoms in the past. No further information available to EMS at this time. After medical interventions, the patient awoke. She denied having any medical complaints, including: chest pain, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, numbness, tingling, weakness, dizziness, blurry/double vision, fever, cough, and rash. She last remembers going to bed last night. She last recalls eating lunch yesterday. She does not recall eating dinner or taking her nightly medication, including Insulin. She denies injuries. She denies consuming ETOH and/or use of illicit substances. Medical history, medications, and allergies as noted. There are no other associated signs/symptoms at this time.

Rx: BGL: 20 mg/dL. An IV was established in the patientâ€™s left AC after one attempt using a 20 g catheter. The line was flushed with 10 mL normal saline and a saline lock was established. The patient was placed on a continuous 4-lead ECG and the rhythm was interpreted as sinus rhythm, no ectopy. Two-provider cross check was performed for Dextrose 10% administration (indication is hypoglycemia): right patient, right medication, right dose, right route, right time. 250 mL Dextrose 10% was administered via IV bolus, with improvement of symptoms. BGL: 220 mg/dL. The patient was placed on 2 L O2 via NC. BP obtained x 1. HR, RR, and O2 saturation obtained x 2. T: All movements of the patient were made without incident. Upon scene arrival, the patient was assisted to the semi-fowlers position in bed via EMS personnel. Upon waking up, the patient was assisted to the seated position in bed. She remained seated for the duration of patient care. Refusal: When offering the patient transport to a hospital to be evaluated for her current condition, the patient indicated that she did not want to be transported to the hospital. The patient felt that EMS transport and further medical evaluation were not necessary at this time. The patient's mental status was re-assessed and she was alert and oriented to a level where she could make a competent and informed decision. The possible risks and complications that are associated with refusing care were discussed with the patient and she was instructed to call 911 or seek immediate medical attention if her symptoms were to re-appear or become worse. The patient had an opportunity to ask all questions and understood all of the information presented to her. The patient signed the refusal and was left in the care of her son; witness signature obtained. E: None noted at this time. S: Patient signature obtained. Witness signature obtained. D.
